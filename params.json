{"name":"Hacklet","tagline":"An Open Source client for the Modlet (smart) outlet","body":"# Hacklet [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mcolyer/hacklet.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mcolyer/hacklet)\r\n\r\nA library, written in Ruby, for controlling the [Modlet] (smart) outlet.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't heard of the Modlet before, it's a smart outlet cover\r\nwhich allows you to convert any outlet into your house into a smart\r\noutlet. This means that you can control whether a plug is on or off and\r\nyou can also determine how much energy it's using with a sampling\r\nfrequency of 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nThere are alot of other similar products but this is the first one that\r\nI've see that [costs $50][amazon] and includes control as well as monitoring of\r\nthe independent sockets.\r\n\r\n## Why\r\n\r\nSo why write another client?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the client software included with the device isn't\r\navailable on all platforms (Linux) and it's pretty heavyweight for what\r\nit does.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is provide all the same functionality of the\r\nbundled client but do it in a lightweight manner, to provide total\r\ncontrol and availability of the data.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nRight now things are pretty rough and won't work without modifying\r\n`bin/hacklet`. Eventually the `hacklet` script will allow for specifying\r\nwhich Modlet and socket you'd like to read or control.\r\n\r\n```\r\nbundle install\r\nsudo modprobe ftdi_sio vendor=0x0403 product=0x8c81\r\nbin/hacklet\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n\r\n* [X] Reading Data\r\n* [X] Controlling Sockets\r\n* [X] Multiple Modlet Support\r\n* [X] Commissioning New Devices\r\n* [X] Useful utility\r\n* [ ] Set time on New Devices\r\n* [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n[Modlet]: http://themodlet.com\r\n[amazon]: http://www.amazon.com/ThinkEco-TE1010-Modlet-Starter-White/dp/B00AAT43OA/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
